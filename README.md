## Description:

A Gradle 1.9 project that compiles some C code to a shared library, some groovy
code that loads that library via JNA and a Spock test to make sure it works.

Gradle 1.9 introduced the incubating `c` plugin, so names no longer appear to be
mangled.

## Known Issues

 - Not tried this project on Windows or Linux ;-)
